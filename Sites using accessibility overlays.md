> Accessibility overlays are plugins used on websites with claims making them accessible for people with disabilities and compliant to EAA amongst other laws. This is of course nonsense.
> This list aims to put focus on companies buying the overlays to be able to ensure monitoring agencies in Europe have an easy way to monitor the usage.
> Please help keep this list up to date with pull requests (PR).

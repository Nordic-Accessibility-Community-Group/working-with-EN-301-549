They had identified many digital accessibility errors and issued an order of correction accordingly. HelsMI worked to reduce the defect list, but many errors remained even as the initial deadline passed. The authority then issued a decision imposing a compulsory fine and set a December 19 deadline to correct the remaining errors. After this, daily fines of 50,000 kroner (approximately USD$5,360) will start."

## About the template
This accessibility statement template for the is based on the demands from the EU-directive for the public sector.
The focus is on assisting the user rather than merely outlining legal requirements and shortcomings/failures. THe monitoring agencies are for the EAA referred to as market surveillance.

### What does the law say?
It isn't currently very clear what an accessibility statement is expected to look like, many require one which you can see in the list [Table of countries under the EAA](https://github.com/Nordic-Accessibility-Community-Group/working-with-EN-301-549/blob/main/monitoring-agencies-information.md). What is clear is that you must document your accessibility compliance status and make this documentation available to your users.
You need to report any known accessibility issues to the appropriate government agency for each country you're active in.

You also need to describe the accessibility or inaccessibility of products in your online store.

#### Documentation required for the EAA
> [CHAPTER IV  Obligations of service providers  Article 13  Obligations of service providers](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32019L0882#cpt_IV)
> 
> 2.   Service providers shall prepare the necessary information in accordance with Annex V and shall explain how the services meet the applicable accessibility requirements. **The information shall be made available to the public in written and oral format, including in a manner which is accessible to persons with disabilities.** Service providers shall keep that information for as long as the service is in operation.
> 
> 4.   In the case of non-conformity, service providers shall take the corrective measures necessary to bring the service into conformity with the applicable accessibility requirements. Furthermore, where the service is not compliant with applicable accessibility requirements, service providers **shall immediately inform the competent national authorities of the Member States in which the service is provided**, to that effect, giving details, in particular, of the non-compliance and of any corrective measures taken.

[Annex V-  Information on services meeting accessibility requirements](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32019L0882#anx_V)
> 1. The service provider shall include the information assessing how the service meets the accessibility requirements referred to in Article 4 in the general terms and conditions, or equivalent document. The information shall describe the applicable requirements and cover, as far as relevant for the assessment the design and the operation of the service. In addition to the consumer information requirements of Directive 2011/83/EU, the information shall, where applicable, contain the following elements:
> 
> > a. a general description of the service in accessible formats;
> 
> > b. descriptions and explanations necessary for the understanding of the operation of the service;
> 
> > c. a description of how the relevant accessibility requirements set out in Annex I are met by the service.
> 
> 2. To comply with point 1 of this Annex the service provider may apply in full or in part the harmonised standards and technical specifications, for which references have been published in the Official Journal of the European Union.
> 
> 3. The service provider shall provide information demonstrating that the service delivery process and its monitoring ensure compliance of the service with point 1 of this Annex and with the applicable requirements of this Directive.

#### Documentation required for the The Web Directive (WAD)
[Preamble to the European Web accessibility directive, Recital 44](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2016/2102/oj/eng#rct_44:~:text=An%20accessibility%20statement)
> (44) An accessibility statement should be provided by public sector bodies on the compliance of their websites and mobile applications with the accessibility requirements laid down by this Directive. That  accessibility statement should include, where appropriate, the accessible alternatives provided for.

#### Disproportionate burden
For the public sector the government agencies have been very strict in what they accept as disproportionate burden. In Sweden, Digg has stated that if a company risks bankruptcy by implementing accessibility fixes immediately, it is still required to make the fixes but may plan to do so over a longer period.
[Criteria for assessment of disproportionate burden](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32019L0882#anx_VI)
The directive says that an assessment needs to be made and documented to be able to claim disproportionate burden.

## How accessible are our digital services?
Although we're committed to accessibility, we recognise that not everything is fully accessible to all our visitors at this time. This is something we're working to address, and we'd be very grateful if you could report any issues to [customer service](http://) so we can improve the experience for everyone. In this section, we describe the accessibility of our websites, apps, social media and other services.

### Our websites
#### TheMainSite.com
> Here you'll write a list of accessibility issues that you're aware of. It's recommended that you start with a general, easy-to-read description on what different user groups may encounter, such as the following example.

As a visually impaired user, you may encounter images without descriptive text and forms which aren't correctly parsed by screen readers.

As a user with impaired hearing, ....

> For this part with detailed issues you could put each item in a collapsible element such as [details disclosure](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/details). If you have multiple such elements it's helpful to provide an "Expand all" option. The following is an example of how to list an issue. Remember that even though the law says you need to address issues covered by the law - this takes time to evaluate and it is better to focus on the user experience instead of compliance. If you do that - you will cover most of the legalities too.
##### Images lack ALT text

**Description:** Many of the images on the site currently lack alternative text (ALT text) which is accessible to assistive technology such as screen readers.  

**Action:** We are continuously reviewing our editorial material and adding missing descriptions.
